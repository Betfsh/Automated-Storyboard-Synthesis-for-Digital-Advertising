# Semantic Image and Text Alignment:Automated-Storyboard-Synthesis-for-Digital-Advertising

## Introduction:

This project aims to automate the process of transforming textual descriptions of advertisement concepts and assets into detailed storyboards. The project leverages machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision technologies to generate visually compelling storyboards that encapsulate the essence of proposed ad campaigns. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, data sources, and tasks involved.

## Business Objective:

The objective of this project is to streamline the advertising production process by automating the conversion of textual advertisement concepts and assets descriptions into visually engaging storyboards. By harnessing advanced machine learning algorithms, the goal is to significantly reduce the turnaround time for creating ad campaigns while enhancing creativity and efficiency.

## Data:

The project uses various datasets, including assets folders containing images, sample concepts with assets and size descriptions in JSON format, and storyboard examples. These datasets serve as inputs for generating visual and textual assets, composing advertisement frames, and building the final storyboard.


## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git@github.com:Betfsh/Automated-Storyboard-Synthesis-for-Digital-Advertising.git`
